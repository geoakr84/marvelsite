            <h2>Wolverine</h2>
            <p>
                Born with super-human senses and the power to heal from almost any wound, Wolverine was captured by a secret Canadian organization and given an unbreakable
                skeleton and claws. Treated like an animal, it took years for him to control himself. Now, he's a premiere member of both the X-Men
                and the Avengers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wolverine was conscripted by Department H, and for his first mission was sent against the incredible Hulk. Wolverine
                was subsequently approached by Professor Charles Xavier, who was looking for mutants to help his students, the X-Men,
                escape from the island-being known as Krakoa, which had captured them. Wolverine left Alpha Flight to accompany Xavier
                and rescue the captured X-Men. After Krakoa was defeated, Wolverine decided to stay with the X-Men, for reasons which
                included that he had fallen for Marvel Girl (Jean Grey). Logan remained with the X-Men for quite some time, at one time
                being their field commander, and encountered adversaries such as Proteus (Kevin MacTaggart), Magneto (Magnus),
                the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, the Brood, the Reavers, demons from the dimension of Limbo, the Marauders, the Morlocks,
                and even Dracula on one occasion.
            </p>
            <p>
                After his encounter with the mutant assassin Omega Red, Logan began to question the memories he possessed, but his
                searches to find his true identity and memories proved fruitless. During an encounter with the mutant Magneto on his
                space station called Avalon, Wolverine slashed Magneto with his claws. Magneto retaliated, using his powers of the
                magnetic field to tear the adamantium out of Wolverine's skeleton, causing extensive injuries. These injuries shorted
                out Wolverine's healing factor for a time, and Logan also discovered that the claws that he believed a result of the
                Weapon X project were in fact part of his actual bone structure due to his mutation. These bone claws became Wolverine's
                main weapons until his skeleton later became grafted to adamantium again.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result of his injuries, Logan left the X-Men for a time. He visited Muir Island at the request of Kitty Pryde,
                and was also attacked by Cyber. During the Phalanx invasion, Logan and Cable were asked by Charles Xavier to find
                and rescue the captured X-Men. They joined with Cyclops (Scott Summers) and Jean Grey returning from their honeymoon
                (and secretly the future) and freed their teammates in Tibet. Later, Logan was kidnapped by Tyler Dayspring, calling
                himself Genesis, who wanted to make Wolverine one of his new Horsemen. Genesis had acquired adamantium by destroying
                the body of the mercenary known as Cyber, and had planned to recreate the bonding process used on Logan years ago.
                This time, however, Logan's body rejected the adamantium, and he regressed for a time to a feral-like state.

            <p>Wolverine is a mutant who possesses the ability to regenerate damaged or destroyed areas of his cellular structure at a rate far greater than
                that of an ordinary human. The speed at which this healing factor works varies in direct proportion with the severity of the damage Wolverine
                suffers. For example, he can fully recover from an ordinary gunshot wound in a non-vital area of his body within minutes, but it took him almost
                two months to fully recover from injuries sustained in a duel with Lord Shingen, which included one from a sword that went all the way through
                his trunk.Wolverine’s natural healing also affords him virtual immunity to poisons and most drugs, as well as an enhanced resistance
                to diseases. For example, it is nearly impossible for him to become intoxicated from drinking alcohol. He also has a limited immunity to the
                fatigue poisons generated by bodily activity, and hence he has greater endurance than an ordinary human. His agility and reflexes are
                similarly enhanced.In addition, Wolverine’s healing factor provides him with an extended lifespan by slowing the effects of the aging process. </p>
